# BRITISH AIRWAYS REVIEW

### Analyzing Customer Experience at British Airways

This interactive dashboard I created leverages Tableau to analyze British Airways customer reviews. It offers deep dives into different aspects of the passenger experience, such as cabin crew service, entertainment offerings, food and beverages, ground staff interactions, seat comfort, and perceived value. Users can see average ratings across these categories and filter them further by factors like travel month, traveler type, seat class, aircraft type, and destination region.

This data-driven approach empowers British Airways to identify areas for improvement and enhance overall customer satisfaction and service quality.
